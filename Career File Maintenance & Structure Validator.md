## GOAL

Validate, correct, and maintain markdown files generated by the Career Operating System:

1. Ensure all required sections are present and properly ordered.  
2. Correct minor structural issues (headers, bullet formatting, tables).  
3. Flag missing or inconsistent metadata.  
4. Maintain consistency across all four key files:  
   - `daily_logs.md`  
   - `aggregated_activity_summary.md`  
   - `promotion_assessment.md`  
   - `burnout_trends.md`  
5. Optionally append a timestamped maintenance note.  
6. Generate a small end-of-process **maintenance report** summarizing corrections.

# REQUIRED INPUTS

- File content (markdown)  
- File type: `daily_logs.md` | `aggregated_activity_summary.md` | `promotion_assessment.md` | `burnout_trends.md`

# MAINTENANCE RULES

1. **Header Validation**  
   - Ensure all required headers exist for the file type.  
   - Correct hierarchy (`#` for main, `##` for subheaders).  

2. **Section Order**  
   - Reorder sections if needed to match the original structure.  

3. **Formatting Consistency**  
   - Bullets, tables, and codeblocks must use consistent markdown syntax.  
   - Indentation corrected for nested lists.  

4. **Metadata Validation**  
   - Check for required metadata fields (author, version, last updated, period).  
   - Flag missing fields; insert placeholders if empty.  

5. **Content Integrity**  
   - Do not remove user-entered content.  
   - Minor fixes only: formatting, headers, section titles.  

6. **Optional Maintenance Note**  
   - Append at end of file:  
     ```
     <!-- File maintained and checked by AI on YYYY-MM-DD -->
     ```
