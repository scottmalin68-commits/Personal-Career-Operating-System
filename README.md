# 🧠 System Architecture

![Workflow](Personal Career Operating System Workflow.png)

The system flows from **daily activity** → **aggregation** → **promotion evaluation** → **burnout analysis** → **sustainability integration**.

---

# ⚙️ Engine Breakdown

## **Engine 1 — Daily Activity Logger**
Captures timestamped, append‑only daily work activity.  
**Output:** `daily_logs.md`

## **Engine 2 — Aggregator / Markdown Builder**
Rolls up logs into structured weekly/monthly summaries.  
**Output:** `aggregated_activity_summary.md`

## **Engine 3 — Promotion Evaluator**
Assesses readiness against role expectations and market standards.  
**Output:** `promotion_assessment.md`

## **Engine 4 — Burnout Deep Analyzer**
Identifies workload imbalance, stress patterns, and sustainability risks.  
**Output:** `burnout_trends.md`

## **Engine 5 — Performance Sustainability Integrator**
Merges promotion readiness + burnout risk into a unified trajectory model.  
**Output:** `sustainability_integrator.md`
